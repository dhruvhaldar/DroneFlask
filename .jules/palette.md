## 2024-05-22 - Missing Animations
**Learning:** The project uses `animate-fade-in-down` class but it is not defined in the standard Tailwind configuration or custom CSS, leading to missing animations.
**Action:** When using utility classes for animation, always verify they are standard Tailwind or explicitly defined in the project's config/CSS. For this project, stick to standard animations or inline styles if needed.
