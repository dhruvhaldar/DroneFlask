## 2024-05-22 - Initial Setup
**Learning:** Performance optimization requires measuring both IO and Network bottlenecks.
**Action:** Always check for high-frequency loops (like physics steps) containing blocking IO (print) or network calls.

## 2024-05-22 - Adaptive Pacing
**Learning:** Fixed `time.sleep(dt)` in a simulation loop guarantees drift (slower than real-time) because it adds sleep *on top* of execution time.
**Action:** Use adaptive pacing: calculate `target_time = start + elapsed_sim_time` and sleep `target_time - now`. Use `time.sleep(0)` if lagging to yield without delay.
